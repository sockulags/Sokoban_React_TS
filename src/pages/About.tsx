      <h1>What is Sokoban?</h1>
      <p>
        Sokoban is a classic puzzle game that originated in Japan in the early
        1980s. Its name translates to "warehouse keeper" in Japanese. The game
        features simple yet challenging gameplay that has captivated players for
        decades.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Sokoban was created by Japanese game designer Hiroyuki Imabayashi in
        1981. It gained popularity in Japan and was later introduced to the
        international gaming community. The simplicity of its concept combined
        with its challenging gameplay made it a hit among puzzle enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Sokoban has been ported to various platforms and has
        inspired numerous adaptations and sequels. Its enduring appeal has
        solidified its status as one of the most iconic puzzle games of all
        time.

          <h2>Goal</h2>
          The objective of Sokoban is to push all the boxes onto the storage
          locations (marked by dots) within the warehouse. Once all the boxes
          are correctly placed, the level is completed, and the player can
          progress to the next challenge.

          <h2>Controls</h2>
          <h3>Desktop</h3>
          Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player
          character around the warehouse. You can push boxes by moving into them
          from the direction you want them to move.
          <h3>Mobile</h3> On mobile devices, a directional pad (D-pad) will
          appear on the screen. Tap the arrows on the D-pad to move the player
          character in the corresponding direction. To push boxes, simply move
          the character towards them.
        </div>

        <div
          id="rules"
          className={`tab ${activeTabPlay === "rules" ? "active" : ""}`}
        >
          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>
            The player character can only push one box at a time. Boxes can only
            be pushed, not pulled. Boxes can't be pushed into walls or other
            boxes, so plan your moves carefully! The warehouse may contain
            obstacles such as walls or tight spaces that restrict movement.
            Deadlocks: Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls
            with no way to move them, as this can lead to a deadlock situation
            where the puzzle becomes unsolvable. If this happens, the player may
            need to restart the level.

          <h2>Power-ups</h2>
          <p>
            There are two types of levels: regular levels and levels featuring
            power-ups. These power-ups grant the player special abilities,
            providing them with unique superpowers. They activate when the
            character steps over them during the level.
          </p>
          <h3>Super strength</h3>
          <p>
            With Super Strength activated, you can push two boxes
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <h3>Drag box</h3>
          <p>
            When activating Drag Box, you gain the ability to drag a box by
            pressing the Ctrl button.

          <h2>Highscore</h2>
          <p>
            The game has a scoring System based on the number of moves taken and
            the time elapsed to complete each level. Strive to achieve the
            highest score possible by solving puzzles efficiently.

            <li>
              <b>Avoid Getting Stuck: </b>If you push a box into a corner or
              against a wall with no space to move, you may get stuck and need
              to restart the level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Use Reset Functionality: </b>If you do get stuck you can use
